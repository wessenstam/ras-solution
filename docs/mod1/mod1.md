During the duration of the lab you have been granted access to use a cloud tenant. Your cloud tenant URL should have been sent to you prior to this workshop. if you don't have received your credentials, please speak to your instructor to get your tenant URL. The URL will look something like ``https://<tenant>.my.centrify.net/``
The username to use will be ``admin@lab.<tenant>``. The password will be set default to **Delinea/4u**, unless you have received the invitation email and already logged into the tenant and change the password.

The invitation email, a screenshot below as example, should be sent to you earlier.

# Conclusion

As summary of the lab the following has been setup, configured and tested:

- Log into a Cloud Tenant
- Deploy a cloud connector
- Integrate an existing Secret Server
- Configure the Cloud Tenant
- Test the configuration

Using a few relative simple steps, an existing Secret Server installation can be integrated to a Cloud Tenant where a contractor can be given access to a system which lives in an infrastructure that does not have any inbound connectivity changes being made to a firewalled environment.
